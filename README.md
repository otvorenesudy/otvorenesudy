Public data project aimed at creating much more user friendly interface to interesting public data provided by [Department of Justice](http://www.justice.gov.sk) and [The Judicial Council](http://www.sudnarada.sk) of Slovak Republic

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.2
* Rails 3.2
* PostgreSQL 9.1
* Elasticsearch 1.7
* Redis 3.4

### PostgreSQL

Setup Trigram extension for desired Rails environments

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib -y
sudo service postgresql restart
cd /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/extension/
RAILS_ENV=development
psql -U postgres -d opencourts_$RAILS_ENV -f pg_trgm--1.0.sql
```

### Elasticsearch

Enable Groovy dynamic scripting  

```
script.engine.groovy.inline.aggs: on
script.engine.groovy.inline.search: on
```

## Installation

```
git clone --recursive git://github.com/otvorenesudy/otvorenesudy.git
cd otvorenesudy
bundle install
```

## Configuration

```
cp config/configuration.{yml.example,yml}
cp config/database.{yml.example,yml}
```

## Images Generation

Use Ruby 2.6.6 locally and install `gem install svgeez` and `npm install -g svgo@1.3.2`. After that, run `app/assets/images/compile`.

## Data

*Following commands across this section should be executed subsequently in general*

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
```

Note that the seed data are essential for the next steps

### Courts and judges
