    The Open Courts portal has been updated.
    <br><br>
    Due to the data export outage on the side of the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic, the Open Courts portal did not contain all the current information for the past few months. We have fixed the data synchronization since May 2024 and the portal contains all available information.

    Thank you for your patience and understanding.
