    The Open Courts portal is up to date.
    <br><br>
    Open Courts portal did not contain all the current information for the past few months due to the data export outage on the side of the Ministry of Justice of the Slovak Republic. We have changed the data synchronization since May 2024 and the portal contains all available information.

    Thank you for your patience and understanding.
