Well-functioning of the judicial system has an important impact on the quality of public life
and of democracy. A well-functioning and trustwothy judiciary is a necessary pre-condition for a good
business environment as well as civic life. Slovaks are not satisfied with the current state
of judiciary. According to <%= link_to 'Eurobarometer from the fall of 2009', 'http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_374_en.pdf' %> 
only 29% of people in Slovakia trust the courts. At the same time, every twelfth household that
has been in touch with judiciary paid a bribe according to
<%= link_to '2013\'s Global Corruption Barometer', 'http://transparency.sk/sk/kazda-piata-domacnost-zaplati-rocne-aspon-jeden-uplatok' %>.

We do not know much about the work of judges and courts. One of the reasons for that is the fact that restrictions
regulating access to information with regard to judiciary are stricter than those regulating information from government or parliament.

Simultaneously, discussions about the functioning and the quality of judiciary suffer from two major shortcomings. Firstly,
they are often over-generalizing (“judges are corrupt”) without any clear reference to those responsible or without any identification
of problems. Secondly, majority of discussions are held only among unnecessarily restricted group of legal professionals. Open Courts
aim to contribute to the improvement of the discussion about Slovak judiciary in three ways:

1. improvement of accessibility of information about activities and performance of judges and courts, 
2. the data are interconnected and allow for comparisons,
3. doing so on the level of particular judges and courts.
