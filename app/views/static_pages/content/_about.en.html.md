Well-functioning of the judicial system has an important impact on the quality of public life
and of democracy. A well-functioning and trustwothy judiciary is a necessary pre-condition for a good
business environment as well as civic life. Slovaks are not satisfied with the current state
of judiciary. According to the Eurobarometer from 2018, less than 30% of Slovak general public perceive courts as independent.

During the last few years we have been able to find more information about courts and judges,
but restrictions of access to other information related to their activity still exist.

Simultaneously, discussions about the functioning and the quality of judiciary suffer from two major shortcomings. Firstly,
they are often over-generalizing (“judges are corrupt”) without any clear reference to those responsible or without any identification
of problems. Secondly, majority of discussions are held only among unnecessarily restricted group of legal professionals. Open Courts
aim to contribute to the improvement of the discussion about Slovak judiciary in three ways:

1. improvement of accessibility of information about activities and performance of judges and courts, 
2. the data are interconnected and allow for comparisons,
3. doing so on the level of particular judges and courts.
